#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
   SELECT COUNT(orderid)
   FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
   WHERE length(orderid) = 6
   AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
    
#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
   SELECT COUNT(orderid)
   FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
   WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
   AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
   AND length(orderid) = 6;
             
#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.      
    SELECT acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers
    LEFT OUTER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
    ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
    WHERE orderid <> 'Order ID'
    AND length(orderid) = 6;
    
 #4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?   
   SELECT JanSales.Product, JanSales.Price
   FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
   WHERE Price IN (SELECT MIN(price)
   FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);
    
 #5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
   SELECT SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue ,product
   FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
   GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
    SELECT FebSales.location, FebSales.Product, FebSales.Quantity, SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue 
    FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
    WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101';

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
     SELECT COUNT(distinct Cust.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
     FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb 
     LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers Cust
     ON Cust.order_id = Feb.orderID
     WHERE Feb.quantity > 2 
     AND length(orderid) = 6
     AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
